# Crag finder Frontend

### Project still in progress (22.06.23)

this is a frontend to crg finder application. This is a app, where you can add new, update abd delete exisiting crags. 
And of course display crags by chosen keys.

### Backend to this project is available at:
https://github.com/L00ka5z78/crag-finder-BE

### Some thoughts
I think that backend to this app is actually done and works well. There are some small features which
I would like to add, but in my opinion it it not needed (like swagger docs).

Frontend is also written in general, but there are few issues I'm facing this days (22.06.23). And this is connection FE with BE.
I got stuck in one place and cant move forward without fixing this. So if you are checking this project and see some
bugs, so thats right. They exist :) But hopefully I will fix them soon, as daily life, and other challenges allows me .
